## What are Coffee License Stamps?

Coffee License Stamps are **copy-paste ready copyright notices** that make using the Coffee License as simple as possible. Instead of manually creating copyright headers, just copy a stamp, fill in your details, and paste it at the top of your files.

## Why Use Stamps?

**Traditional licensing process:**
1. Choose a license
2. Add LICENSE file to your repo
3. Remember to add copyright notices to source files
4. Hope you formatted it correctly
5. Include all necessary legal information

**Coffee License + Stamps:**
1. Copy stamp for your language
2. Fill in the placeholders
3. Paste at top of files
4. **Done** - everything needed is already there

## How to Use

1. **Choose your language** from the collection
2. **Replace the placeholders:**
   - `[YEAR]` → 2025 (or current year)
   - `[NAME]` → Your name or company name
   - `[EMAIL]` → Your contact email
   - `[AMOUNT]` → License fee (default: $50)
   - `[BIG_CORP]` → Example mega-corp (Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc.)
3. **Copy and paste** at the top of your source files

## What This Accomplishes

**For developers:**
- ✅ Zero confusion about licensing
- ✅ Professional-looking copyright notices
- ✅ Consistent formatting across projects
- ✅ All legal information embedded

**For companies:**
- ✅ License terms clearly visible in every file
- ✅ Contact information readily available
- ✅ Fee amount and threshold crystal clear
- ✅ No excuse for "didn't know" about licensing

## Philosophy

The Coffee License is about making courtesy as easy as possible. These stamps remove every barrier to proper attribution and licensing compliance. 

**If compliance is easier than avoidance, everyone wins.**
