# Why the Coffee License?

**TL;DR:** MIT does too little. GPL does too much. Coffee License does just enough.

## The Problem I'm Solving

You spend months building something useful. You release it open source because you believe in sharing knowledge. Then you discover Apple, Google, or Amazon is using it in production. You never knew. They never said thanks. You got nothingâ€”not even acknowledgment.

This happens millions of times across the software ecosystem.

But there's a deeper issue: **the fundamental loneliness of open source development.** You build tools that potentially help millions, but you exist in a vacuum. Did it work? Does anyone care? Are you making a difference? Most of the time, you never find out.

## What We Want vs. What We Get

**What open source developers actually want:**
- People to use their software freely
- To know who's finding it useful
- Basic acknowledgment when mega-corps benefit from their work
- Maybe a connection or relationship with users
- **Evidence that their work matters**

**What current licenses give them:**
- **MIT:** Complete freedom, zero acknowledgment, total anonymity
- **GPL:** Complex requirements that often just scare people away
- **Dual licensing:** Usually complex, expensive, focused on restricting usage

## The Coffee License Approach

> *"If you can afford it, you can pay for the software you use."*

This isn't about enforcementâ€”it's about establishing what decent ecosystem behavior looks like. It's **human reverse engineering of compliance**: instead of trying to catch violations, I make acknowledgment easier than avoidance.

### The Good Faith Philosophy

I believe all software interactions should be based on mutual respect and good faith. That's why some Coffee License projects include both the free license AND the commercial license right in the repository.

No hunting. No barriers. No gotcha moments. 

**I trust you to do the right thing.**

This approach makes non-compliance genuinely unreasonableâ€”not because of legal threats, but because I've removed every possible excuse and made courtesy trivially easy.

### The Barrier is Intentionally Tiny

- **$50 fee:** Less than an hour of a corporate lawyer's time
- **Simple contact:** Just send an email
- **Universal acknowledgment:** Copyright notice stays in the code either way

The barrier is so low that non-compliance becomes genuinely unreasonable. What billion-dollar company can't afford $50 and a "thanks for the useful software" email?

### It's About Relationships, Not Revenue

This isn't a business modelâ€”it's a relationship model:

- **Developers learn who uses their work** (impossible with pure MIT)
- **Companies connect with the creators** (potential hiring, collaboration)
- **Everyone wins:** Small gesture, huge goodwill, better ecosystem

When a company pays the $50 and sends that email, doors open. Suddenly you're not just an anonymous GitHub usernameâ€”you're a real person who solved their real problem.

## Democratizing Knowledge While Requesting Courtesy

The Coffee License embodies a core principle: **knowledge should be accessible to everyone, but courtesy should be proportional to capability.**

- **Students, indie developers, small companies:** Get complete freedom because every barrier matters
- **Mega-corporations:** Asked for basic acknowledgment because they can afford common courtesy

This isn't about restricting accessâ€”it's about **scaling courtesy to match resources**. Everyone gets the same technical freedoms; only the wealthiest are asked to engage socially.

## Why This Works in Practice

### 1. **Legal Teams Prefer Clarity**
"Just pay the $50" is simpler than analyzing complex license terms or building custom legal frameworks.

### 2. **Companies Avoid Bad PR**
"Billion-dollar company refuses to pay indie developer $50" is not a headline anyone wants.

### 3. **It's Already Normal**
Companies regularly spend more on:
- Conference sponsorships
- Open source foundations
- Developer swag
- Legal compliance for far more complex requirements

### 4. **The Acknowledgment is Universal**
Even with the commercial license, your copyright notice stays in their code. You get credit regardless of which path they choose.

### 5. **Human-Centered Design**
The Coffee License applies storytelling and user experience principles to legal frameworks. Instead of optimizing for legal complexity, it optimizes for human relationships and clear communication.

Every interaction should feel like **human talking to human**, not **legal entity negotiating with legal entity**.

## This is a Cultural Statement

I'm not trying to revolutionize software licensing. I'm trying to establish that:

**Basic courtesy should be normal in the software ecosystem.**

When someone builds something useful and shares it freely, and you're a billion-dollar company benefiting from itâ€”acknowledge that. Say thanks. Make a connection.

It's not about the money. It's about recognition, relationships, and building a more courteous open source world.

The $50 is really saying: *"Please just email me and let me know you exist? ðŸ˜­"*

## What Success Looks Like

- **Indie developers** know who uses their work
- **Companies** build relationships with creators instead of anonymous consumption  
- **The ecosystem** becomes more connected and collaborative
- **Basic acknowledgment** becomes as standard as including dependencies in package.json
- **Open source development** becomes less lonely and more collaborative

Success isn't measured in dollars collected, but in:
- Emails received from companies saying "thanks"
- Developers who know their work matters
- Relationships formed between creators and users
- A cultural shift toward acknowledgment and courtesy

## The Alternative

Keep the status quo: anonymous consumption, zero acknowledgment, missed opportunities for everyone.

Indie developers build in isolation, never knowing if their work helps anyone. Companies extract value without building relationships. The ecosystem remains fragmented and impersonal.

Or try to make "thanks for the useful software" a normal part of how we do business.

**I choose acknowledgment.**
