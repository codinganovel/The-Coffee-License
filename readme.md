# ‚òï Coffee License

**A simple, fair license for indie developers**

*"Free for everyone. Coffee money for billionaires."*

or

> ‚ÄúIf you're above the threshold but would prefer not to pay, feel free to restructure your assets until you're technically not.‚Äù

## What is this?

The Coffee License is a permissive open source license that asks mega-corporations to pay a small fee (default: $50) while keeping software completely free for everyone else.

## The Problem

You build amazing open source software. Companies worth hundreds of billions use it in production. You never even know they exist, get no acknowledgment, and definitely get no coffee money.

## The Solution

**Coffee License = MIT License + Basic Courtesy**

- ‚úÖ **Free for 99.99% of users** (individuals, startups, small companies)
- ‚úÖ **Same freedoms as MIT** (use, modify, distribute, sell)
- ‚úÖ **Only mega-corps pay** (default: $500M+ net worth)
- ‚úÖ **Tiny fee** (default: $50 - literally coffee money)
- ‚úÖ **Forces acknowledgment** (they have to contact you)

## Quick Start

1. **Copy license files** to your project root:
   - `LICENSE-COFFEE.md` (rename to `LICENSE.md`)
   - `LICENSE-COFFEE-COMMERCIAL.md` (keep as-is)

2. **Fill in the placeholders:**
   - `<year>` ‚Üí 2025
   - `<name>` ‚Üí Your Name  
   - `<amount>` ‚Üí $500,000,000 (or your preferred threshold)
   - `{email}` ‚Üí your.email@domain.com
   - Commercial fee ‚Üí $50 (or your preferred amount)

3. **Add to your README:**

```markdown
## License

This project is licensed under the Coffee License.

- **Free for personal/commercial use** (entities under $500M net worth)
- **$50 commercial license** for mega-corporations
- See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details
```

## Who This Affects

**Spoiler: Probably not you!**

- üü¢ **Individual developers** ‚Üí Free
- üü¢ **Students/educators** ‚Üí Free  
- üü¢ **Startups** ‚Üí Free
- üü¢ **Small/medium companies** ‚Üí Free
- üü° **Large corporations** ‚Üí Free (unless mega-wealthy)
- üî¥ **Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.** ‚Üí $50 please ‚òï

## Customization

You can adjust the threshold and fee for your needs:

```
Default: $500M threshold, $50 fee
Conservative: $1B threshold, $25 fee  
Aggressive: $100M threshold, $100 fee
```

## Why This Works

1. **Legal teams prefer clarity** ‚Üí $50 is simpler than analyzing weird license terms
2. **Companies avoid bad PR** ‚Üí "Billion-dollar company refuses to pay indie dev $50"
3. **Developers get recognition** ‚Üí Forced contact creates relationships
4. **Everyone wins** ‚Üí Small fee, huge goodwill

## Industry Precedent

This isn't a radical new concept - **tiered pricing based on company size is already standard**:
- Apple charges 15% vs 30% App Store fees based on revenue
- Google has similar graduated pricing structures
- Amazon uses volume-based pricing across services

Coffee License just applies this proven model to open source licensing.

## Economics, Not Discrimination
Coffee License doesn‚Äôt discriminate against persons or groups - it uses standard economic pricing based on objective, public criteria:

	‚úÖ Measurable threshold: Net worth is factual, not subjective
 	‚úÖ Universal application: Same rules for everyone above the line
	‚úÖ Changeable status: Economic conditions can be restructured
	‚úÖ Industry standard: Ability-to-pay pricing is everywhere

If this were ‚Äúdiscrimination,‚Äù then so would be:
	
‚Ä¢	Student discounts
	
‚Ä¢	Progressive taxation
	
‚Ä¢	Enterprise software pricing
	
‚Ä¢	Senior citizen discounts
	
‚Ä¢	Volume pricing tiers

The choice is simple: Either ability-to-pay pricing is legitimate business practice, or half the economy is ‚Äúdiscriminatory.‚Äù

Coffee License treats economic capacity the same way every other industry does - those with greater resources contribute proportionally to the systems they benefit from.

## FAQ

**Q: How do companies actually pay?**
A: They email you for payment details. Keep it simple - PayPal, Stripe, whatever works.

**Q: What if a company's valuation is unclear?**
A: Use your best judgment. The goal is courtesy, not gotcha moments.

**Q: Can I change the amounts?**
A: Absolutely! Customize the threshold and fee for your project.

## Files

- [`LICENSE-COFFEE.md`](LICENSE-COFFEE.md) - The main license (free version)
- [`LICENSE-COFFEE-COMMERCIAL.md`](LICENSE-COFFEE-COMMERCIAL.md) - Commercial version  
- [`WHY.md`](WHY.md) - Philosophy and reasoning
- [`STAMPS.md`](STAMPS.md) - Stamps are **copy-paste ready copyright notices** that make using the Coffee License as simple as possible.
- [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt) - The cc0 License the entire repo is in.

## Which Files Do I Need?

- **For your project:** Copy and customize `LICENSE-COFFEE.md` ‚Üí rename to `LICENSE.md`
- **For companies:** They get `LICENSE-COFFEE-COMMERCIAL.md` after payment
- **Optional:** Include both in your repo (shows good faith)

## Philosophy

Software should be free and accessible. But when mega-corporations benefit from community work, basic acknowledgment and a token contribution seem reasonable.

This isn't about getting rich. It's about:
- ‚úä **Recognition** for indie developers
- ü§ù **Relationships** between creators and users  
- ‚òï **Basic courtesy** in the software ecosystem
